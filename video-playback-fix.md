# Video Playback Fix for Hero Sections

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Video Attributes
Added the following attributes to all video elements to improve compatibility and performance:

- `controls={false}` - Disables video controls for background videos
- `disablePictureInPicture` - Prevents picture-in-picture mode
- `disableRemotePlayback` - Prevents remote playback on external devices

### 2. Files Updated
The following pages have been updated with improved video implementations:

- `alphaahead-frontend/src/pages/TheAcresPage.js`
- `alphaahead-frontend/src/pages/CityWalkPage.js`
- `alphaahead-frontend/src/pages/NadAlShebaGardensPage.js`
- `alphaahead-frontend/src/pages/MadinatJumeirahLivingPage.js`
- `alphaahead-frontend/src/pages/BluewatersPage.js`
- `alphaahead-frontend/src/pages/ElevePage.js`

### 3. Video File Sizes
Current video file sizes that may cause loading issues:

- `/Meraas/The Acres Hero Section.mp4` - 18MB
- `/Meraas/City Walk/Citywalk-video.mp4` - 13MB
- `/Meraas/NASG/NASG-1920x1080-WEB Stack Video_0.mp4` - Size unknown
- `/Meraas/MJL/MJL_Development Page and MJL Residence page.mp4` - Size unknown
- `/Meraas/Bluewaters/Bluewaters_Drone-.mp4` - Size unknown
- `/deyaar/ELEVE/Eleve_Launch_Video_60s_FINAL_HD-1.mp4` - Size unknown

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Video Optimization
Consider compressing the videos to reduce file sizes:

**Recommended specifications:**
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- Bitrate: 2-4 Mbps for 1080p, 1-2 Mbps for 720p
- Format: MP4 with H.264 codec
- Target file size: 5-10MB maximum

### 2. Hosting Considerations
- Ensure your hosting provider supports video streaming
- Consider using a CDN for better video delivery
- Check if your hosting plan has file size limits

### 3. Browser Compatibility
The current implementation includes:
- `autoPlay` - For automatic playback
- `loop` - For continuous looping
- `muted` - Required for autoplay in most browsers
- `playsInline` - For mobile compatibility
- `preload="auto"` - For better loading performance
- `poster` - For fallback image while video loads

### 4. Performance Tips
- Use poster images that match the video content
- Consider lazy loading for videos below the fold
- Implement loading states for better user experience

### 5. Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test with slow internet connections
- [ ] Verify autoplay works with muted attribute
- [ ] Check that poster images display correctly
- [ ] Ensure videos loop properly

### 6. Deployment Notes
- Ensure all video files are properly uploaded to the hosting server
- Check that file paths are correct in the deployed version
- Verify that the hosting provider supports the video file sizes
- Consider implementing a fallback to static images if videos fail to load

## Current Video Implementations

All hero section videos now include:
```jsx
<video 
  autoPlay 
  loop 
  muted 
  playsInline 
  preload="auto"
  className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover z-0"
  poster="/path/to/poster-image.jpg"
  controls={false}
  disablePictureInPicture
  disableRemotePlayback
>
  <source src="/path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

This implementation should resolve the video playback issues on deployment while maintaining good performance and compatibility across different devices and browsers.
